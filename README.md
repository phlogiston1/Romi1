## for challenge 1
### features:
- drivetrain with tank (left, right), arcade (forward, turn), position, and velocity drive options
- arcade drive with throttle max speed adjustment
- custom odometry + kinematics
- no-guessing inverse kinematics to get the ratio of wheel speeds to drive a smooth arc through a given point
- custom path following, with acceleration changes for faster streights and corners (incomplete)
